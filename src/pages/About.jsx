        I have always had an interest in anything computer science related and
        knew I wanted to have a career in it. I was exposed to web development
        in late 2021 and absolutely loved it, since then I have taken front-end
        courses, created projects, and completed project challenges in order to
        reinforce everything I have been learning and obtain new knowledge along
        the way.

        I'm currently in the last stretch of my coding bootcamp through
        University of Minnesota (UMO). The bootcamp has provided me
        opportunities to drastically improve my frontend skills in addition to
        letting me dip into the backend development side of projects. Though I
        prefer frontend, I strive to be proficient in backend to allow myself to
        be more diverse and adaptive.

        Outside of coding I have a deep passion for the gym and bodybuilding,
        hoping in the near future I will be able to create my own following and
        inspire others to begin their fitness journey.
